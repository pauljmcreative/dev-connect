## An Easy to Use App
11
**Employers:** We prioritize the whole student so you don't just get a faceless resume or an impersonal profile. Check out our projects, learn about the immersive, and, most importantly, if we're a good snack fit for your company.

13
**Students:** Let employers know what you're about by letting them know not just your skills and accomplishments but also who you are. Let your personality shine through by sharing your aspirations, ~~plots for world domination~~, and interests. Show off your projects and easily add new ones as you complete them, or edit and delete them to keep your portfolio up to date.

## Our Design

Utilizing the Materialize UI design, our website is easy to navigate, image heavy, and mobile first. We make sure to include ample whitespace to provide a pleasing, tested user experience in collaboration with General Assembly's UI/UX bootcamp students.
